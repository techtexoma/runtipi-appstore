# Prefect

Prefect is a modern workflow orchestration framework designed for building, scheduling, and monitoring robust data pipelines. It empowers data engineers and data scientists to create reliable, scalable, and observable workflows with ease.

## Key Features

- **Workflows as Code**: Define your data pipelines using pure Python, allowing for version control and easy collaboration.
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Create workflows that adapt to your data and business logic in real-time.
- **Distributed Execution**: Run your tasks across multiple machines or in the cloud for improved performance and scalability.
- **Rich Observability**: Monitor your workflows with detailed logs, real-time status updates, and customizable notifications.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatically handle retries, failures, and complex dependency management.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Schedule your workflows to run on any cadence, from minutes to months.

## Getting Started

1. Once the Prefect app is installed and running, access the Prefect UI through your Runtipi dashboard.
2. Use the Prefect CLI (available in the `cli` service) to create and manage your workflows.
3. Write your workflows as Python scripts and store them in the `/root/flows` directory, which is mapped to `${APP_DATA_DIR}/flows` on your host system.
4. Use the Prefect UI to monitor your workflows, view logs, and manage schedules.

## Basic Usage Example

Here's a simple example of a Prefect flow:

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

@flow
def hello_flow(name="World"):
    say_hello(name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_flow()
```

Save this script in your flows directory and run it using the Prefect CLI:

```bash
prefect deployment build hello_flow.py:hello_flow -n my-first-deployment -q default
prefect deployment apply hello_flow-deployment.yaml
prefect agent start -q default
```
